<!-- “Tamalpais, beautiful coastal mountain, rising from Pacific waves and falling into bayside marshes. Crowned in silver rock and wreathed in manzanita. Grassy slopes and twisted laurels face eastern winds, fires grow on moist north slopes, redwoods in canyons. Above summer’s bright fog roof, down southern and eastern flanks, a chaparral cloak of miniature trees, and everywhere in spring a world of flowers.”
                                   - Tom Killion, Tamalpais Walking: Poetry, History, and Prints -->
<!-- This was later changed to the Miwok word tamalpais (tam-al-pie-us), which, roughly translated, means “bay mountain” or “coast mountain.” -->


<!-- Marin Journal, Volume 53, Number 11, 16 March 1916 -->
<!-- Origin and pronunciation of the name of Mt. Tamalpais, by Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Chief of the Bureau of Biological Survey, Department of Agriculture, U. S. A. Not Spanish—but Indian. In the language of the local tribe, the country their country was called "Tamal" for many centuries. Their word meaning "Mountain" was. as we would spell it, "Pi-Is" or "PI-Ss." The Spaniards, for purposes of correct pronunciation. in their language, rendered the name "Tamalpais." The word is pure Indian,—not Spanish —and means Tamal Mountain. Similarly 06-na-pi-is, Is the name of Sonoma Mountain. Tamalpais Is properly pronounced In four syllables—Tam-mal-pl-ls, with the accent on the first and third syllables, but Is usually slurred to Tam-al-pals with the "1" long and dwelt upon (Tamalpice.) (Note:—Dr. Merriam Is the best known authority on the subject of the Pacific Coast Indians and Is one of the few scientific men who have studied their language and customs.)  -->

 <!-- On a clear day, visitors can see the Farallon Islands 25 miles out to sea, the Marin County hills, San Francisco and the bay, hills and cities of the East Bay, and Mount Diablo. Coastal Miwok Indians lived in the area for thousands of years before Europeans arrived. In 1770, explorers named the mountain La Sierra de Nuestro Padre de San Francisco, which was later changed to the Miwok word "Tamalpais." -->
