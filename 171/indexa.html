        <h2>Thoughts on Identity & Belonging</h2>

            Alone together

"The irony of social media - alienates us from others and puts us at odds with ourselves"
<br><br>

In a not too distant past, an individual could experiment with their identity to discover what fit them. 
What they said or did left little trace. Young people, especially, could easier find private and low stakes spaces to explore their identity, while supported by local community of real time interactions. With low commitment to experiments and transient accountability for every expression of identity, the pressure to stay "on brand" was alleviated.
<br><br>

Our modern society presents unique challenges to the major tasks of adolescence and early adulthood - self-discovery and carving out an individual identity - long before we are developmentally ready. 
Exposure to social media occurs as early as in 4-5th grade and children are faced with thinking about how to manage a public self, before getting to know their internal self first. In this setting individual discovery and appreciation for truly belonging directly competes with homogeneity and socially fitting in.
<br><br>

In the process of self-discovery there exists learning by social comparison, an organic part of human growth. When coupled with social media performance and its associated vanity metrics, it invites external evaluation as a tool for validation. Carefully cultivated presentations of self stand in for real time interactions, each posting documented indefinitely for tireless scrutiny. Not only does it matter how many likes one got, but also more importantly how many others have observed the approval. The reinforced desire for acceptance simultaneously robs users of their individual experiences and erodes authenticity in the process.
<br><br>

The permanence also causes individuals to feel stuck defending what would otherwise be an outdated identity, not able to grow into their full selves. Public media personalities rely on PR agents and managers to maintain a consistent profile. In lieu of such aids, a public profile which lacks individual importance quickly becomes disorienting, while garnering self-loathing for participation in the rituals in the first place. When aired with psychological fragility, often times a result of contemporary over parenting, it is a setup for feelings of insecurity, failure and rejection. What would naturally evolve as integrated self-awareness quickly, turns into an accelerated battle for self-preservation and self doubt.
<br><br>

Developing a Substantive self – requires time away from social media.
It is in solitude that you find that to be yourself, you need to be with yourself. Maintaining real, embodied relationships, which operate in real time, is nurturing and essential for identity development and understanding of own emotional patterns and reactivity.
True social support and validation allows for experimentation free from judgement and the experience can provide an internal sense off accomplishment for the self to stand on.

        <h2>Thoughts on Time</h2>
        <div id="post2" class="content">
            <p>
                "A life in the past cannot be shared with the present. Each person who gets stuck in time gets stuck alone"
                <br><br>"When you realize you are mortal you also realize the tremendousness of the future." 
                
<br>
<br>"If time and reason are functions of each other, if we are creatures of time, then we had better know it, and try to make the best of it." 
<br><br><br> "Time is the substance I am made  of. Time is a river which sweeps me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger which destroys me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire which consumes me, but I am the fire."
<br><br>Everyone is on their own journey, but <b>we</b> are the journey.
<br><br><br>
The past decades of research in the fields of psychology and neuroscience suggest the experience of time is the foundation of personal identity and empathy.
Perhaps more evident than ever before is our individuality and subjective perspectives.
We’re exposed to global beliefs and opinions, and have the time to reflect on, and shape our own. Identifying differences and commonalities, driven by a desire to find an individual sense of self.

But our individual truths are not necessarily in competition with each other, they rather intertwine. 
More recent understanding of time and space has the potential to bridge, not only the interpersonal gap between the inner worlds we inhabit as humans, but also the universal ruliad of choices presented to observers like us.
