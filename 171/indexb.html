        <p>
                "A life in the past cannot be shared with the present. Each person who gets stuck in time gets stuck alone"
                <br><br>"When you realize you are mortal you also realize the tremendousness of the future." 
                
                <br>"If time and reason are functions of each other, if we are creatures of time, then we had better know it, and try to make the best of it." 
<br><br><br> "Time is the substance I am made  of. Time is a river which sweeps me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger which destroys me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire which consumes me, but I am the fire."
<br><br>Everyone is on their own journey, but <b>we</b> are the journey.
<br><br><br>
The past decades of research in the fields of psychology and neuroscience suggest the experience of time is the foundation of personal identity and empathy.
Perhaps more evident than ever before is our individuality and subjective perspectives.
We’re exposed to global beliefs and opinions, and have the time to reflect on, and shape our own. Identifying differences and commonalities, driven by a desire to find an individual sense of self.
<br><br>
But our individual truths are not necessarily in competition with each other, they rather intertwine. 
More recent understanding of time and space has the potential to bridge, not only the interpersonal gap between the inner worlds we inhabit as humans, but also the universal ruliad of choices presented to observers like us.

Idea of authenticity, desirable?
But necessity?

Ideally
Completeness vs compatibility
Cultural ideals, honesty, truth
Superman - truth, justice, the american way

What changed- 
Market push pull - individual prosperity,
Attempts to further maximize, optimize, wealth accumulation, extraction

Cargo culting until you get what you want - (safety not guaranteed)
Not even malicious intent, just difference between how we perceive things work, and how things actually work

What's wrong about what changed
Tired of manipulation of needs and desires by  marketers, celebrity endorsers, paid influencers

Yearning for authenticity

Fragmentation and fluidity of external environment
Diversification of once stable structures (family, religion, national identity, gender)
Understanding of current events flooded by mis- and disinformation, even those we experience ourselves.

Everyday life merges with simulated and synthetic experiences, AI enhances and distorts reality.
Forcing us to redefine what self is
Psychological difficulties arise when truth is not reliable and established. 
Facts need to be questioned and agreed on to be real, today

Authenticity directly impacts self-esteem, coping ability, meaningful goal pursuit and other parts of healthy psychological functioning.  Foundation of shared reality, bedrock of social life. Contributes to a personally meaningful existence, on an individual level.


What is authenticity
Personalities are not singular. Grapple with thoughts and ways of relating to others. Our psychological make up consists of different contrasting and contradictory aspects.
Greater authenticity is greater awareness of multifaceted self-aspects and drive to integrate them into cohesive self-structure.
As an idea, it shapes and propels the individual identity through the constantly changing stream of experience.

As a feeling, authenticity feels good.
Lack of it, or feeling inauthentic is part of development as we nurture new parts of ourselves across the life span
Clinging too tightly to what feels like authenticity can hinder growth

The heart of authenticity - unimpeded operation of one's true self, in one's daily enterprise.
Discover, develop, construct core sense of self and, how core is maintained over time and situation
Activity spaces:
Awareness, unbiased mental processing, ways of behaving, relational orientation


Awareness
Do you know what you like? What feels good?
Can identify good feeling, but do you know the source?

Unbiased processing
Low Interprative distortions
Low Ego defense mechanism
Leads to choices that further self-development


Behavior
Self deception to attain?
For others, social comparison?
Willing to endure negative consequences, by expressing true beliefs

Relational orientation
How easy do you make it for close others to get to know you
Important for others to see the dark, not routinely discussed. Accurate perception, fosters secure attachment.


Passport to growth
Less need for Defensiveness, in face of self-threatening information
Perception of threat to self-image

    `Alone together
    <br><p>
"The irony of social media - alienates us from others and puts us at odds with ourselves"
<br><br>

In a not too distant past, an individual could experiment with their identity to discover what fit them. 
What they said or did left little trace. Young people, especially, could easier find private and low stakes spaces to explore their identity, while supported by local community of real time interactions. With low commitment to experiments and transient accountability for every expression of identity, the pressure to stay "on brand" was alleviated.
<br><br>

Our modern society presents unique challenges to the major tasks of adolescence and early adulthood - self-discovery and carving out an individual identity - long before we are developmentally ready. 
Exposure to social media occurs as early as in 4-5th grade and children are faced with thinking about how to manage a public self, before getting to know their internal self first. In this setting individual discovery and appreciation for truly belonging directly competes with homogeneity and socially fitting in.
<br><br>

In the process of self-discovery there exists learning by social comparison, an organic part of human growth. When coupled with social media performance and its associated vanity metrics, it invites external evaluation as a tool for validation. Carefully cultivated presentations of self stand in for real time interactions, each posting documented indefinitely for tireless scrutiny. Not only does it matter how many likes one got, but also more importantly how many others have observed the approval. The reinforced desire for acceptance simultaneously robs users of their individual experiences and erodes authenticity in the process.
<br><br>

The permanence also causes individuals to feel stuck defending what would otherwise be an outdated identity, not able to grow into their full selves. Public media personalities rely on PR agents and managers to maintain a consistent profile. In lieu of such aids, a public profile which lacks individual importance quickly becomes disorienting, while garnering self-loathing for participation in the rituals in the first place. When aired with psychological fragility, often times a result of contemporary over parenting, it is a setup for feelings of insecurity, failure and rejection. What would naturally evolve as integrated self-awareness quickly, turns into an accelerated battle for self-preservation and self doubt.
<br><br>

Developing a Substantive self – requires time away from social media.
It is in solitude that you find that to be yourself, you need to be with yourself. Maintaining real, embodied relationships, which operate in real time, is nurturing and essential for identity development and understanding of own emotional patterns and reactivity.
True social support and validation allows for experimentation free from judgement and the experience can provide an internal sense off accomplishment for the self to stand on.
